# [ ] I. The hardedcode phase - Data is hardcoded and compile in our code.
  - [ ] Read data from in-memory. (Variable)
  - [ ] More and more data? - Using array.
  - [ ] Dynamic data, data adding without change our code. - User input.
  - [ ] More and more and more? - Increase array length.

# [ ] II. Handling array bounds - Data is still in memory, but...
  - [ ] Infinite growth - Save data in RAM by Allocator

# [ ] III. RAM screams
  - [ ] Comeback with file storage and use it smarter - Save, find data in binary form.
